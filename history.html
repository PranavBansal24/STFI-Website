            <p>
                Speak Takraw Is a Traditional Malaysian sport and is popular in south East Asian countries. It is'
                played in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Philippines, Brunei and Indonesia. Sepak Takraw was
                introduced
                in India in 1980 when a group of sports enthusiast in Nagpur obtained printed materials and
                photographs
                from the Sepak Takraw Federation of Malaysia with Shri Tajuddin Ahmed as the Secretary General.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                During the same period a meeting of sports lovers was held in the office of Nagpur Sharirik Shikshan
                Mahavidyalaya and Sepak Takraw Federation of india was formed with Adv. S. W. Dhabe, Member of
                Parliament as its President, Mr. Salim Baig as Secretary General an Mr. Joseph Rao as treasurer. The
                formation of Federation was on the eve of the Asian Games held in Delhi from Nov. 19 1982 to Dec. 4,
                1982, to Dec. 4, 1982. Since the Sepak Takraw was a demonstration sport in Asian Games '82 in Delhi,
                a
                Sepak Takraw contingent from the Asian Sepak Takraw Federation (Hq. Kualalumpur) was invited by the
                spl.
                Organising Committee of the Asian Games. The contingent comprised of playing members from Malaysia,
                Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei and India.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The newly formed Sepak Takraw federation of India was entrusted with the organization of the event
                at
                Karnail Singh Stadm in Delhi on Nov. 23 in the afternoon. The demonstration was a big success and
                team
                from South East Asian countries along with infant Indian team gave a spectacular show before a
                capacity
                crowd in Delhi. The demonstration was telecast live and print media gave a very good coverage, the
